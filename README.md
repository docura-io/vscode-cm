# VSCode CM Extension

## Overview
This is a VSCode extension to add CM ([Configura](http://configura.com), CET Designer/Developer) language
support.

## Installation
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is required to use this extension, yuou can get
a free copy from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download.

To Install download the latest from Downloads page, and then open the `VSIX` 
file from VSCode `File -> Open`. (Do not double click the VSIX file to install)

## Working Folder
This extension is built to have your specific extension folder open. E.G. if 
your extension is under `/custom/mycompany` you should open this folder in 
VSCode. Opening the entire CM_ROOT will probably cause your computer to explode
in a blaze of awful glory :fire:

## Working Settings
```
 "cm.clearOutputBuild": true,
 "cm.autoComplete80Enabled": true,
 "cm.root": "auto",
 "[cm]": {
     "editor.suggestOnTriggerCharacters": false,
     "editor.quickSuggestions": {
         "other": false,
         "comments": false,
         "strings": false
     }
 }
```
## Running
The extension will automatically start when a `.CM` file is opened.

To start the CM Compiler press `F1` and select the "CM: Start CM" or "CM: Start 
CET Designer"

`Ctrl + Shift + U` will show the output window. There is a channel called "CM" 
that shows the output from the CM Compiler.

## Configuration
You'll need to set your workspace path (You can also set your `User Settings`
 instead to have it persist to all
), `File -> Preferences -> Workspace Settings`. 
Set the following:

```JSON
{
    "cm.root": "C:\\CetDev\\version6.5-_build-train"
}
```

## Recommended Settings

```JSON
"cm.autoComplete80Enabled": true,
"cm.root": "auto",
"[cm]": {
    "editor.suggestOnTriggerCharacters": false,
    "editor.quickSuggestions": {
        "other": false,
        "comments": false,
        "strings": false
    }
}
```

## Commands
The following commands are available:

- CM: Start CM - `N/A`
- CM: Stop CM - `N/A`
- CM: Clean CM - `Shift + F5`
- CM: Run Current File - `CTRL + ALT + P`
- CM: Run Current Line - `CTRL + ALT + Space`
- CM: Compile Current - `CTRL + ALT + U`
- CM: Quit Debug - `CTRL + ALT + Q`
- CM: Start CET Designer - `N/A`
- CM: Profile Boot - `N/A`
- CM: Load All Known - `CTRL + ALT + Y`
- CM: Start writing output to file - `N/A`
- CM: Stops writing output contents to file - `N/A`

## Building
After cloning the repository, from command prompt run:
```shell
npm install
```

Currently, you'll need to copy `node_modules\cm-modules\findDefinition\out\variableFinder.js` to `out\node_modules\cm-modules\findDefinition`. At some point I'll figure out a way to make this better, but for now this works.

If you don't have node installed, you'll need to install it from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.  You can then open the folder in vscode by just typing `code .` You should be able to build and run the project by just hitting `F5` within VSCode.  It will launch a new "Extension Development" instance of VSCode, which will automatically run the compiled version of the extension over the one you have installed.  See https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/extensions/overview for more information and API documentation.
